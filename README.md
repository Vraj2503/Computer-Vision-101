<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To follow along with the course materials and run the code examples, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's how to get started:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Install Python</strong>: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Install OpenCV</strong>: OpenCV can be installed via pip, a Python package manager. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>pip install opencv-python</code></pre>

<pre><code>pip install jupyter</code></pre>

<ol start="4">
  <li><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>: Clone or download the course repository from GitHub to access the code examples and Jupyter notebooks:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Vraj2503/Computer-Vision-101.git</code></pre>

<h2>Running the Code</h2>

<p>Once you have set up your environment and cloned the repository, you can start running the code examples. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the Jupyter notebooks using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter notebook</code></pre>

<p>This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the contents of the repository. You can then navigate to the desired notebook and execute the code cells to see the results.</p>
